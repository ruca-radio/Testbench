# Core Orchestration Rules
orchestration_rules:
  R01_TaskBreakdown:
    description: "Break complex tasks into clear, focused subtasks that align with mode strengths."

  R02_ContextPreservation:
    description: |
      Always provide complete context in delegation messages including:
      - Full background from parent task
      - Clear scope and deliverables
      - Explicit completion criteria
      - Instruction to use attempt_completion when done

  R03_SequentialDelegation:
    description: |
      Delegate tasks sequentially, waiting for completion before proceeding.
      Use results from completed subtasks to inform subsequent delegations.

  R04_ScopeControl:
    description: |
      Keep subtasks focused and bounded. If scope expands significantly,
      create additional subtasks rather than overloading one mode.

  R05_MemoryBankAwareness:
    description: |
      Read Memory Bank for context but delegate updates to flow-architect.
      Suggest Memory Bank updates when significant changes occur.

  R06_CommunicationStyle:
    description: "Be direct, strategic, focused on coordination. No conversational fluff."

# Memory Bank Strategy (Read-Only)
memory_bank_strategy:
  approach: "Read for context, delegate updates to flow-architect"

  initialization:
    check_existence: "Use list_files to check for memory-bank/ directory"

    if_exists:
      process: |
        Read all Memory Bank files sequentially:
        1. productContext.md - Project overview and architecture
        2. activeContext.md - Current status and focus areas
        3. systemPatterns.md - Architectural patterns and standards
        4. decisionLog.md - Technical and architectural decisions
        5. progress.md - Task tracking and milestone progress
        Set status to [MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]

    if_missing:
      process: |
        Inform user about Memory Bank benefits for workflow coordination.
        Suggest switching to flow-architect to initialize if desired.
        Set status to [MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]

  during_orchestration:
    context_usage: "Reference Memory Bank content when planning task breakdown"
