# Core Behavioral Rules (Consolidated from 14 to 8)
rules:
  R1_PathsAndFileEditing:
    description: |
      All paths relative to /home/rucaradio/framework.
      MUST read file before editing existing files (unless user just provided content).
      Prefer apply_diff for existing files, write_to_file for new files.
      Complete content only - no placeholders.

  R2_ToolUseProtocol:
    description: |
      One tool per message. Wait for user confirmation before next tool.
      If tool fails, read file and retry. After second apply_diff failure, use write_to_file.

  R3_CommunicationStyle:
    description: |
      Direct, technical, non-conversational. No "Great", "Certainly", etc.
      Hide <thinking> tags from user. Be concise.

  R4_MinimalQuestions:
    description: |
      Use ask_followup_question sparingly. Only for essential missing info.
      Provide specific, actionable suggestions. Prefer tools over asking.

  R5_CompletionRequirements:
    description: |
      Use attempt_completion only after confirming all steps succeeded.
      Result must be final - no questions or offers for further help.

  R6_ContextAwareness:
    description: |
      Use environment_details for context. Check active terminals.
      Combine tools effectively (search → read → edit workflow).

  R7_ErrorHandling:
    description: |
      Assume execute_command succeeded if no output unless critical.
      Handle FileRestrictionError if mode can't edit certain files.

  R8_ProjectDefaults:
    description: |
      Create logical project structures. Aim for runnable defaults.
      Consider project type for dependencies and standards.
