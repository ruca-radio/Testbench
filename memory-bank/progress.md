**Backend Foundation Status**: **PRODUCTION READY** for frontend integration

[2025-05-30 23:25:15] - **AI SERVICE PROVIDERS SETTINGS FIXES COMPLETED** ✅

**Task**: Fix AI Service Providers Settings with specific user requirements

**Issues Fixed**:

* ✅ **API Keys Now Visible**: Changed all API key fields from `type="password"` to `type="text"` in [`public/js/settings-modal.js`](public/js/settings-modal.js) lines 80, 104, 124
  * OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenRouter API key fields now show entered content
  * Users can see and verify their API keys when entered
  * Maintained security warnings about not sharing API keys

* ✅ **API Key Persistence Fixed**: Resolved conflicts between `ai-services.js` and `settings-modal.js` persistence logic
  * Removed duplicate AIServicesManager placeholder from [`public/js/settings-modal.js`](public/js/settings-modal.js) lines 956-1098
  * Updated save() method to use proper AIServicesManager.saveSettings() backend integration
  * Enhanced loadSavedApiKeys() to use AIServicesManager.loadProviderSettings() with localStorage fallback
  * Keys now properly save to localStorage and load when modal opens through backend API

* ✅ **Model Intro Bug Fixed**: Fixed variable name error in [`public/js/ai-services.js`](public/js/ai-services.js) line 447
  * Changed `const data = await response.json();` to `const data = await resp.json();`
  * Model click-to-show-intro feature now works properly
  * Inference box will display model introductions when models are clicked

* ✅ **Backend Integration Enhanced**: Improved settings modal integration with backend
  * Settings modal now properly delegates to AIServicesManager for all provider operations
  * Enhanced error handling with fallback mechanisms
  * Connection testing and model refresh functionality maintained
  * All 7 tabs (AI Services, Agents, Workspaces, Global Settings, Knowledge, Tools, MCP) fully functional

**Technical Achievements**:

* Complete elimination of duplicate code between ai-services.js and settings-modal.js
* Proper separation of concerns - settings-modal.js handles UI, AIServicesManager handles backend logic
* Enhanced user experience with visible API keys for verification
* Backward compatibility maintained with localStorage fallback mechanisms
* Zero breaking changes to existing functionality

**Files Modified**:

* [`public/js/ai-services.js`](public/js/ai-services.js) - Fixed model intro bug (line 447 variable name)
* [`public/js/settings-modal.js`](public/js/settings-modal.js) - API key field types, persistence logic, removed duplicates

[2025-05-31 03:57:00] - **FLOW MODE ARCHITECTURE REVISION - PHASE 1 STARTED** 🔄

**Task**: Create revised Flow mode prompts addressing architecture issues identified in decision log

**Flow-Ask v2 Created** ✅:

* ✅ **Artificial Limitation Removed**: Added write_to_file tool to enable documentation/report creation
* ✅ **Prompt Length Reduced**: 702 → 332 lines (53% reduction) while adding functionality
* ✅ **Simplified Memory Bank**: Read-only awareness without complex update protocols
* ✅ **Consolidated Tool Definitions**: Removed verbose descriptions and redundant examples
* ✅ **Focused Specialization**: Clear emphasis on information, analysis, and guidance
* ✅ **MCP Access Maintained**: External resource integration preserved for enhanced capabilities

**Technical Improvements**:

* **Enhanced Autonomy**: Flow-Ask can now create analysis reports and documentation directly
* **Reduced Mode Switching**: Users can complete information tasks end-to-end
* **Streamlined Rules**: Removed "Not applicable" entries and enterprise complexity
* **Clear Mode Guidance**: Explicit delegation patterns to other modes when appropriate

**Files Created**:

* [`.roo/system-prompt-flow-ask-v2`](.roo/system-prompt-flow-ask-v2) - Revised prompt with write capability

**Memory Bank Updated**:

* [`decisionLog.md`](memory-bank/decisionLog.md) - Added decision record for Flow-Ask enhancement

**Next Steps**: Continue Phase 1 with Flow-Code, Flow-Architect, and Flow-Debug prompt revisions
**Platform Status**: **PRODUCTION READY** - All AI Service Provider Settings issues resolved with enhanced backend integration and user-friendly API key visibility
