## Decision: Flow Mode Architecture Revision - Simplification and Consistency Enhancement

**2025-05-31 03:39:00** - Flow Mode Architecture Redesign

### Rationale

After comprehensive analysis of the current Flow mode prompt architecture in [`.roo/`](.roo) directory, several critical issues require architectural revision:

#### **1. Consistency Issues Identified**

* **Memory Bank Update Permissions Fragmented**:
  * Flow-Code/Debug can update Memory Bank directly with complex triggers
  * Flow-Ask cannot update Memory Bank ("Flow-Ask mode does not directly update the memory bank")
  * Flow-Architect has extensive Memory Bank management capabilities
  * **Impact**: Inconsistent handoff protocols, user friction

* **Tool Availability Inconsistencies**:
  * Flow-Ask limited to read-only tools (missing apply_diff, write_to_file, execute_command)
  * Flow-Code/Debug have full tool suites regardless of need
  * **Impact**: Artificial limitations requiring unnecessary mode switches

* **Communication Style Rules Duplication**:
  * Identical R07_CommunicationStyle across all modes
  * Some rules marked "Not applicable" but still present
  * **Impact**: Prompt bloat, confusion

#### **2. Over-Engineering Issues**

* **Enterprise-Level Complexity**: 1000+ line prompts with extensive rule systems unsuitable for personal AI tool
* **Unnecessary Memory Bank Protocols**: Complex UMB procedures, detailed trigger systems
* **Verbose Documentation**: Repetitive content across mode prompts
* **Artificial Restrictions**: Mode switching requires user approval for basic operations

#### **3. Collaboration Inefficiencies**

* **Unclear Handoff Protocols**: No clear criteria for when mode switching is beneficial vs. disruptive
* **Fragmented Responsibilities**: Modes defer to others unnecessarily (e.g., Flow-Ask → Flow-Architect for Memory Bank updates)
* **Context Passing Issues**: Inconsistent Memory Bank strategy across modes

#### **4. User Experience Misalignment**

Based on [`productContext.md`](memory-bank/productContext.md) and [`activeContext.md`](memory-bank/activeContext.md):

* **User Wants**: Modular, configurable, extensible ChatGPT-like interface for personal use
* **User Doesn't Want**: Authentication, rate limiting, deployment complexity, enterprise overhead
* **Current State**: Enterprise-grade architecture creating friction for personal tool usage

### Implementation Details

#### **Phase 1: Core Simplification (Week 1)**

**1.1 Memory Bank Access Standardization**

* **All Flow modes get uniform Memory Bank update capabilities**
* **Simplified trigger system**: Update when significant progress/decisions occur (user judgment)
* **Remove complex UMB protocols**: Replace with simple "significant change occurred" updates
* **Consistent status prefix**: All modes show [MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE/INACTIVE]

**1.2 Tool Access Rationalization**

* **Flow-Ask Enhancement**: Add essential tools (apply_diff, write_to_file) for self-sufficiency
* **Tool Subset Optimization**: Each mode gets tools aligned with its core purpose + Memory Bank tools
* **Remove Artificial Barriers**: Modes can perform basic operations without requiring switches

**1.3 Rule System Consolidation**

* **Core Rules Only**: Focus on essential behavioral rules (R01-R06)
* **Remove Mode-Specific Exceptions**: Standardize applicable rules across all modes
* **Eliminate "Not applicable" entries**: Clean rule sets per mode

#### **Phase 2: Collaboration Protocol Redesign (Week 2)**

**2.1 Mode Selection Criteria Clarification**

* **Flow-Code**: Implementation, file creation/modification, technical execution

**2.3 Shared Context Mechanisms**

* **Unified Memory Bank Strategy**: Identical initialization and update patterns across modes
* **Cross-Mode Information Sharing**: Consistent access to project context
* **Reduced Mode Friction**: Minimize administrative overhead of mode switching

#### **Phase 3: Personal Tool Optimization (Week 3)**

**3.1 Prompt Length Reduction**

* **Target**: Reduce each mode prompt from 1000+ lines to 400-600 lines
* **Method**: Remove redundant sections, consolidate common elements
* **Focus**: Core mode identity + essential tools + simplified Memory Bank integration

**3.2 User Experience Enhancement**

* **User Autonomy**: Reduces unnecessary mode switching for basic documentation tasks
* **Natural Workflow**: Information specialists naturally produce written outputs - analysis reports, documentation, summaries
* **Maintains Specialization**: Adding write capability doesn't dilute Flow-Ask's focus on information and analysis

### Implementation Details

* **Tool Addition**: write_to_file tool added with focus on documentation, reports, and analysis results
* **Prompt Reduction**: 702 → 332 lines (53% reduction) while adding functionality
* **Core Identity Preserved**: Still focused on answering questions, analyzing code, explaining concepts
* **Clear Boundaries**: Implementation tasks still delegated to Flow-Code, architecture to Flow-Architect

### Technical Outcomes

* **Enhanced Autonomy**: Flow-Ask can now complete information tasks end-to-end
* **Reduced Mode Switching**: Users stay in Flow-Ask for complete analysis workflows
* **Better User Experience**: Natural flow from analysis to documentation
* **Maintained Clarity**: Mode responsibilities remain distinct and well-defined
