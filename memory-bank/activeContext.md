# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

## Current Focus

**Project Status**: Phase 1 Foundation Cleanup & Enhancement COMPLETED ✅

**Immediate Priority**: Transition to Phase 2: Core Collaboration Features - implementing multi-agent communication and workspace systems with <100ms agent-to-agent latency targets.

**Current Mode**: Flow-Architect mode coordinating Phase 2 planning and Memory Bank updates reflecting Phase 1 milestone achievement.

**Next Major Milestone**: Phase 2 implementation focusing on enhanced agent management, collaboration engine, and workspace system development.

## Recent Changes

**2025-05-30 01:11:06** - **PHASE 1 FOUNDATION CLEANUP & ENHANCEMENT COMPLETED** ✅

* **Phase 1.1**: Main Server Consolidation - Enhanced [`index.js`](index.js) with process error management, root route, WebSocket foundation (Socket.io), enhanced error handling, and response time tracking
* **Phase 1.2**: Provider Enhancement - All 5 providers enhanced with agent context injection, load balancing, and failover mechanisms
* **Phase 1.3**: Database Migration - All 4 collaboration tables verified and 15+ new collaboration functions tested successfully

**Technical Achievements**:

* **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved and verified working
* **WebSocket Infrastructure**: Real-time agent communication foundation established
* **Agent-Aware Providers**: Uniform agent context structure across OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, OpenRouter, MCP
* **Database Ready**: Complete collaboration schema with performance optimization for <100ms latency targets
* **Production Ready**: Process error management, performance monitoring, and failover mechanisms implemented

## Open Questions/Issues

**Phase 2 Implementation Priorities**:

* ✅ ~~**Database Migration Strategy**~~ - RESOLVED: Schema verified and collaboration tables ready
* ✅ ~~**Provider Integration**~~ - RESOLVED: All 5 providers enhanced with agent context
* ✅ ~~**WebSocket Integration**~~ - RESOLVED: Socket.io foundation established
* ✅ ~~**Load Balancing Strategy**~~ - RESOLVED: Provider load balancing and failover implemented

**Current Phase 2 Planning Questions**:

* **Message Broker Implementation**: Redis integration approach for agent message queuing and real-time communication
* **Agent Role Definition**: Detailed specifications needed for orchestrator vs specialist vs reviewer agent roles
* **Collaboration Engine Architecture**: Message routing, turn management, and shared context implementation details
* **Workspace System Design**: Multi-agent workspace creation, agent assignment, and workflow execution patterns

**Technical Decisions for Phase 2**:

* **Conflict Resolution**: Algorithm and priority rules for competing agent actions in shared workspace
* **Context Sharing Scope**: What level of workspace context should be shared between agents vs kept private?
* **Performance Optimization**: Implementation strategies to achieve <100ms agent-to-agent message latency targets
* **Security Model**: Authentication and authorization approach for multi-agent interactions

**Integration & Testing Strategy**:

* **MCP Integration**: Leverage existing MCP infrastructure with new multi-agent communication protocols
* **Testing Strategy**: Approach for testing real-time agent interactions and collaboration workflows
* **Monitoring & Analytics**: Metrics tracking for agent performance, collaboration effectiveness, and system health

**User Experience for Phase 4**:

* **Workspace UI Design**: Specific layout and interaction patterns for multi-agent workspace interface
* **Agent Status Visualization**: Real-time display of agent activities, states, and communication flows
* **Workflow Templates**: Pre-defined multi-agent workflows to prioritize for initial implementation

*2025-05-30 01:11:06 - Active context updated to reflect Phase 1 Foundation Cleanup & Enhancement completion and transition to Phase 2 planning*

[2025-05-30 01:24:14] - **CRITICAL UI ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Current [`public/index.html`](public/index.html) has lost the original 4-column ChatGPT-like layout. Original structure preserved in [`public/index-backup.html`](public/index-backup.html) shows proper layout: (1) Conversations/workspace switcher (25%), (2+3) Main chat with model dropdown (50%), (4) Config panel with agents + MCP servers (25%). Current version oversimplified to basic header+sidebar+chat. User wants drag-and-drop configurable widgets but needs original functionality restored first.

[2025-05-31 03:39:00] - **FLOW MODE ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS COMPLETED** - Comprehensive architecture revision plan created

**Current Focus**: Flow Mode Architecture Revision - addressing consistency issues, over-engineering, and user experience misalignment based on analysis of [`.roo/`](.roo) directory prompts.

**Key Findings**:

* **Memory Bank Update Permissions Fragmented**: Flow-Code/Debug can update directly, Flow-Ask cannot, Flow-Architect has full control
* **Tool Availability Inconsistencies**: Flow-Ask artificially limited to read-only operations, requiring unnecessary mode switches
* **Over-Engineering Issues**: 1000+ line prompts with enterprise-level complexity unsuitable for personal AI tool
* **User Experience Misalignment**: Current architecture creates friction vs. user's goal of "configurable ChatGPT-like interface"

**Revision Plan**: 3-week phased approach focusing on simplification, consistency, and personal tool optimization while preserving mode specialization strengths.
