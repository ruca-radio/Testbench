# AI Inference Platform - Project Brief & Status

## Project Overview

The AI Inference Platform has evolved from a simple chat interface into a comprehensive, multi-model, multi-provider AI platform with advanced features including multi-agent collaboration, widget-based UI, and extensive customization capabilities.

## Original Vision vs Current Implementation

### ✅ Achieved Goals

1. **Multi-Provider Support**
   - Successfully integrated OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, and Ollama
   - Added MCP (Model Context Protocol) support
   - Dynamic model discovery and selection

2. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**
   - Implemented agent roles and orchestration
   - Multiple orchestration modes (sequential, parallel, hierarchical, collaborative)
   - Agent-to-agent communication via `/api/agents/execute` endpoint
   - Human-in-the-loop capabilities

3. **Widget-Based UI System**
   - Drag-and-drop interface with grid layout (12x12)
   - Multiple workspace types (Chat, Agentic, Testing, Collaborative, Research, Development)
   - Core widgets implemented: Chat, Agent Orchestrator, Model Comparison, Shared Chat
   - Widget state persistence and layout saving

4. **Flexible Configuration**
   - Easy provider/model management
   - Agent creation and configuration
   - Workspace persistence
   - Quick configuration options

### 🔄 Partial Implementations

1. **Knowledge Management**
   - Database schema exists for knowledge bases
   - RAG integration planned but not fully implemented
   - Document upload and vector search pending

2. **Real-time Collaboration**
   - WebSocket infrastructure referenced but not fully implemented
   - Shared chat widget created but needs WebSocket backend
   - Turn-based collaboration logic in place

3. **Testing & Benchmarking**
   - Model comparison widget implemented
   - Basic test case management
   - Metrics calculation (response time, quality, coherence)
   - Missing: Advanced benchmarking suite

### ❌ Not Yet Implemented

1. **Advanced Features**
   - Workflow designer (visual workflow creation)
   - Plugin system for custom extensions
   - Advanced metrics and analytics dashboard
   - Export/import of complete workspace configurations

2. **Infrastructure**
   - WebSocket server for real-time updates
   - Redis/message queue for agent communication
   - Vector database for knowledge management
   - Authentication and user management

3. **Additional Widgets**
   - Code Editor Widget
   - Terminal Widget
   - Knowledge Browser Widget
   - Document Viewer Widget
   - Git Manager Widget

## Technical Architecture Alignment

### Current Architecture
```
Frontend (Vanilla JS)
    ├── Widget System (Base classes + implementations)
    ├── Workspace Management
    ├── Agent Management
    └── Provider Integration

Backend (Express.js)
    ├── REST API
    ├── Provider Handlers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
    ├── SQLite Database
    └── Collaboration Engine (partial)
```

### Planned Architecture (from Technical Spec v2)
```
Frontend
    ├── Widget System ✅
    ├── Workspace Management ✅
    ├── Real-time Collaboration ⚠️
    └── Visual Workflow Designer ❌

Backend
    ├── REST API ✅
    ├── WebSocket Server ❌
    ├── Message Broker ⚠️
    ├── Vector Database ❌
    └── Plugin System ❌
```

## Key Misalignments & Recommendations

### 1. Real-time Communication
**Issue**: WebSocket implementation is incomplete
**Impact**: Limited real-time collaboration features
**Recommendation**: Implement Socket.io for WebSocket support

### 2. Knowledge Management
**Issue**: RAG system not fully implemented
**Impact**: Cannot leverage document-based context
**Recommendation**: Integrate vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate/ChromaDB)

### 3. Authentication
**Issue**: No user management system
**Impact**: Single-user only, no access control
**Recommendation**: Add JWT-based authentication

### 4. Workflow Persistence
**Issue**: Workflows are not saved to database
**Impact**: Cannot reuse complex multi-agent workflows
**Recommendation**: Implement workflow serialization and storage

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
**Issue**: Limited automated testing
**Impact**: Reliability concerns for production use
**Recommendation**: Add comprehensive test suite

## Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Stability (Current)
- ✅ Fix frontend functionality issues
- ✅ Implement basic widget system
- ✅ Enable multi-agent communication
- ⚠️ Stabilize provider integrations

### Phase 2: Real-time Features
- Implement WebSocket server
- Add real-time collaboration
- Enable live agent status updates
- Implement message streaming

### Phase 3: Knowledge & Intelligence
- Integrate vector database
- Implement RAG pipeline
- Add document processing
- Enable semantic search

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features
- Add authentication/authorization
- Implement usage tracking
- Add admin dashboard
- Enable multi-tenancy

## Technical Debt

1. **Code Organization**
   - Some widgets use different patterns (extending vs not extending BaseWidget)
   - Inconsistent error handling across providers
   - Mixed async/callback patterns

2. **Database Schema**
   - Some tables created but not utilized
   - Missing indexes for performance
   - No migration system

3. **Frontend Architecture**
   - Global namespace pollution
   - Limited state management
   - No build process/bundling

## Conclusion

The platform has successfully achieved its core vision of being a flexible, multi-model AI inference platform with innovative features like multi-agent collaboration and widget-based UI. However, several advanced features remain to be implemented for production readiness.

The modular architecture allows for incremental improvements, and the foundation is solid for future enhancements. Priority should be given to stabilizing current features while gradually adding the missing components.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Complete WebSocket implementation for real-time features
2. **Short-term**: Add knowledge management capabilities
3. **Medium-term**: Implement authentication and workflow persistence
4. **Long-term**: Add enterprise features and advanced analytics

The platform is approximately 70% complete relative to the full vision outlined in the Technical Specification v2, with strong foundations in place for the remaining features.
